#TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT EXAMPLE


##INTRODUCTION

This kata is inspired by an [example](https://github.com/daylerees/test-driven-development-example) that [Dayle rees](https://twitter.com/daylerees) did it three years ago. I was digging into github looking for some TDD examples, katas, tutorials,... in PHP and i found this example as a great option to learn the fundamentals for TDD. So, i decided to remake it in a more S.O.L.I.D. way.

##WHAT IS THIS FOR

This repository is a guided example where you can learn TDD fundamentals reading and executing tests that we are going to code step by step. 

##HOW DO I READ THIS EXAMPLE

The code will be split in branches named as step-x (step-0, step-1, step-2,...) so when you finish a step you have to change to the next branch|step. I will add some explanation in this README so you have to read this readme before the code when you arrive to a new branch
